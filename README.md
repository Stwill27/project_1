Project about jobs analysis from headhunter.ru. <br>
In this project I took data about job applications from headhunter. The main task was to analyse how do the different signs (like degree of education or place of residence) affect the desired salary. <br>
The project consists:
1. data structure research;
2. data transformation and encoding;
3. data dependency research and visualization using plotly.express and seabornd;
4. data cleaning from omissions and outliers.
   
PS: There are plotly.express graphics in HTML files.
